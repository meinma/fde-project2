# FDE Project 2
This is the implementation of the second project of the course Foundations of Data Engineering offered by TU MÃ¼nchen. It's about analyzing taxi rides in New York with Apache Spark. The implementation is in ReturnTrips.scala file.

## Dataset
Dataset covers one month and consists of time and location for each trip's start and end.

## Used Frameworks, Filesystem and Language
- Apache Spark
- Hadoop Filesystem
- Scala


## Task
The task is to match trips and return trips. For a given trip a, another trip b is considered as a return trip iff:
1. b's pickup time is within 8 hours after a's dropoff time
2. b's pickup location is within r meters of a's dropoff location
3. b's dropoff location is within r meters of a's pickup location
where r is a distance in meters between 50 and 200.

The dataset to be returned contains for each trip a all return return trips b.

## Time limit
The implementation of the query has to be computed in less than 10 minutes.

## Evaluation
The machine used for evaluation will have 64GB RAM and a 6 core Intel i7-3930K processor.
